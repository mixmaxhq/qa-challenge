Postman tool is my first choice for REST API automation. It's very suitable and comprehensive tool for API automation.
It is pretty fast and reliable. Coding tests requiere basic JavaScript knowledge. There are also predefined code snippets which can be
easily used by non experinced people and customized by our needs.


Other suggestion:

Cucumber with Gherkin syntax is my second choice. Cucumber is automation tool which provides writing tests using BDD approach. Gherkin syntax
allows writing test cases in plain english language calling defined cucumber functions written in JavaScript, Ruby, Python etc. BDD approach is not
good for API automation if we have a lot of test cases and edge cases which we want to cover. But, is very useful if we want to present business
logic with few simple test cases and also to have living documentation easy to change and maintain.  unity and documentation is awesome.

Codeless framework (Katalon Studio, TestProject ...) would be my third choice, because you
don't have flexibility and have limited access to the tests. Tests are automatically 
generated, based on user actions. It is very useful if the team has limited technical
knowledge or you don't have enought time and want to automate something fast without coding.
